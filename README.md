## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
