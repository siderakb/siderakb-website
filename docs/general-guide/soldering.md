Some notes on soldering.

## Diodes

Diodes are unidirectional, and soldering them in the incorrect direction can cause the keyboard to malfunction. Please take note of which side is the anode (+) and which side is the cathode (-).

The cathode side of the diode is marked with lines, while the anode side does not have any markings. On the PCB, there is also a line indicating the cathode side. Please solder each diode accordingly, following its polarity mark on the PCB.

## Hot-swappable Sockets

Solder hot-swap sockets with incorrect placement will block the hole.

## Multimeter

After solder is completed, remember to use a multimeter to test whether the power supply (5V, 3.3V and GND) or USB D+/- is not short-circuited.
