## USB Cable Needs Reconnection After Startup

After computer startup, the USB cable needs to be reconnected for the keyboard to respond.

Possible solutions:

1. Try using a different USB port, or switch to a USB 2.0 port (black) instead of USB 3.0 (blue or red).
2. Check the motherboard BIOS/UEFI settings and **disable USB Standby Power** after shutdown. The exact setting name may vary by motherboard, look for options like **ErP Ready** (Energy-related Products) or similar settings and enable it.
