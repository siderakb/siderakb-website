# How to Get/Buy?

I am not selling anything, including parts, kits and finished products.

If you want something, you'll need to order it from other sources. PCBs, 3D printing, and CNC can be ordered from JLCPCB or PCBWay, electronic parts can be found on Mouser or Digi-Key, For more special parts, you may need to search for them on AliExpress or Taobao.

Please note that not everything on GitHub is produced or tested (even for Releases), and even if it is, it is recommended to perform your own inspection.
